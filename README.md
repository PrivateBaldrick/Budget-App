# BudgetApp website

This simple one page website made from scratch with HTML, CSS/SASS. This is my first attempt to use RWD and animations. I used free to use layout made in Figma which I found somewhere on the Internet.

## The project's main goal

In January 2020 I've learnt some basics about SCSS, RWD and Animations. This website was my playground with this technologies. For the first time ever I tried to make responsive webpage and implement as many SCSS features as I could. There are still some minor bugs with RWD on smaller screens, but main goal of this project was to learn how to use all of the above.

In this project I also practised:

- coding according to Figma project;
- Sass;
- RWD (media queries);
- grid, flexbox, before and after selectors;

## Sources

Project in Figma was a free layout found somewhere on the Internet.
